# The Fascinating Journey Behind Your Favorite Web Request: From Typing "https://www.google.com" to Web Page Display

## Introduction

The process of our digital life today turns out to be the person has typed a URL into the Internet browser, and, as a result, the web page is loading. In reality, this seemingly straightforward action lures an even more complex system, which is a group of many dissimilar components of the web stack. In this blog post, we’ll embark on a journey from the moment you type “https: Press “//google.com” into the address bar on your browser. Your screen will now be running the Google home page. We will look at every step of this process: the DNS resolution system, the TCP/IP communication, the HTTPS encryption, the load balancing function, the server-side computation, and the database-driven storage system.

## DNS Request

The journey starts with the making of a DNS request. When you type “https: When you open a browser and press Enter after typing “www.google.com," your browser will need to translate this human-readable name into an IP address that servers can recognize. Request propagates from the DNS server to the DNS resolver, which rescans based on the DNS hierarchy, and keeps looking for the IP address that belongs to “www.google.com”.

## TCP/IP

Furthermore, after the DNS resolver is finished finding out the IP address for the Google servers, your browser will create a TCP/IP connection (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) so that the communication will be successfully done. TCP built the place where data loss cannot happen by dividing the data into packets and adding sequence numbers of each packet and then ordering them at their receiving end.

## Firewall

The fresh packets’ passage cannot reach the firewall that rejects all outside world traffic and forbids it from hacking into the organization’s network. They accomplish this goal by letting or stopping access to certain system resources and blocking harmful attempts.

## HTTPS/SSL

In the modern-day cybersecurity-focused online realm the majority of sites, including Google, encompass HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) to encrypt data between the client and the server. HTTPS makes use of an encrypted connection which can only be assured during an SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security) protocol to establish. This prevents the confidentiality of sensitive information from eavesdroppers and hackers.

## Load Balancer

Large websites that are like those made by Google such as optimize the performance by the use of load balancers to distribute traffic coming in across different servers. Only a load balancer which acts as a traffic cop can balance the load and accordingly distribute the requests evenly through a pool of multiple servers based on different algorithms like round robin and least connections. It guarantees that the web product stays up accessible, scalable, and functional.

## Web Server

Then, the TCP/IP connection is accomplished and the HTTPS handshake is finished by the request is already on one of Google’s web servers. The web server, maybe Apache or Nginx will be the one to receive the request, and then it will handle and process it, including assets such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as other sources required to render the desired web page.

## Application Server

To meet this demand, not just the static content but also the processed content becomes dynamic in modern web applications. It is the exact point when the application server does its job. The application server does the code execution and database connection, and it generates dynamic content based on the user requests. Google cracks this by means of a cleverly designed back-end system that handles search queries, personalized data as well as other functions.

## Database

However, it may so happen that a server will be in charge of fetching or operating data stored in databases. As a simple example, when doing a search on Google, this inquiry is passed on to the application server, which finds the relevant search results from the massive data storage and indexing infrastructure that includes many websites and other types of content.

## Conclusion

A glance at a web request path can be considered one that is comprised of DNS resolution, a database, and many more components, all working in concert to ensure the browser of a user gets the necessary content. This basic process gives the web stack an extra level of being complex; as well this process helps us in building web applications that are fault-tolerant, dynamic, and in sync with the digital world.
