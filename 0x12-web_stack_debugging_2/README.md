# Web Stack Debugging #2

This project is the third installment in a series of web stack debugging projects. In these projects, broken/bugged web stacks were provided in isolated containers, and the task was to fix the web stack to a working state. For each task, a script was written to automate the commands necessary to fix the web stack.

## Tasks ðŸ“ƒ
0. Run software as another user
   - `0-iamsomeonelese`: Bash script that runs the command `whoami` under the user passed as an argument.
   - Usage: `./0-iamsomeonelese <user>`

1. Run Nginx as Nginx
   - `1-run_nginx_as_nginx`: Bash script that fixes a web server to run Nginx listening on port 8080 as the nginx user.

2. 7 lines or less
   - `100-fix_in_7_lines_or_less`: Bash script that fixes a web server to run Nginx listening on port 8080 as the nginx user. It is 7 lines long.
